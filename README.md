# SmartKnowner Major Project (Registration form with Validation)
ðŸ‘‰ This registration form is created by me using HTML , CSS and Javascript

ðŸ‘‰ The important feature of this form is to validate the entries.

    For example - Age should be between 1 to 100 . If age is out of the range , it will throw an error with red highlighted text. 
    
ðŸ‘‰ ALso it will validate the phone number section that it should only be limited to 10 digits. Not more than that not less than that

ðŸ‘‰ <b>Another most important feature of it is that it will be responsive . It will automatically adjust itself according to device's size</b>
