# SmartKnowner Major Project (Registration form with Validation)
👉 This registration form is created by me using HTML , CSS and Javascript
👉 The important feature of this form is to validate the entries.
    For example - Age should be between 1 to 100 . If age is out of the range , it will throw an error with red highlighted text. 
👉 ALso it will validate the phone number section that it should only be limited to 10 digits. Not more than that not less than that
👉 <b>Another most important feature of it is that it will be responsive . It will automatically adjust itself according to device's size</b>
